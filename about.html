                <p>Carrie Hott is an interdisciplinary artist and educator based in Oakland, California.</p>
                <p>Her research and projects are usually focused on technological systems. She is curious about how different forms of technology mediate our experiences on a daily basis, and how these systems came to exist in their present forms. More specifically, she is captivated by what provides a sense  of comfort and security, or keeps us working and productive, or entertained, all while quietly mediating all of our surroundings and experiences, often in very subtle and insidious ways.</p>
